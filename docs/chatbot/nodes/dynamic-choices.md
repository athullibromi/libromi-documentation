# Dynamic Choices

Create intelligent, adaptive choice systems that change based on user behavior, context, and real-time data.

## Overview

Dynamic choice nodes provide intelligent, adaptive selection options. Libromi Connect provides 2 dynamic choice nodes for creating smart, data-driven user interactions.

## Dynamic Node

### Purpose
Create choices that adapt and change based on real-time data and user interactions.

### Features
- **Real-time Updates**: Choices update based on live data
- **Data Integration**: Connect to external data sources
- **Conditional Display**: Show choices based on specific conditions
- **Performance Optimization**: Efficient real-time data handling

### Configuration
- **Data Sources**: APIs, databases, or external feeds
- **Update Frequency**: How often to refresh choice data
- **Filtering Rules**: Criteria for including/excluding options
- **Caching Strategy**: Balance data freshness with performance

### Dynamic Features
- **Live Inventory**: Show only available products/services
- **Real-time Pricing**: Display current prices and discounts
- **Location-based**: Show options relevant to user's location
- **Time-sensitive**: Display choices based on current time/date
- **User-specific**: Personalize choices based on user data

### Use Cases
- Live product availability
- Real-time appointment slots
- Dynamic pricing displays
- Location-based services
- Personalized recommendations

### Example Configuration
```
Data Source: Product Inventory API
Update Frequency: Every 30 seconds
Filters:
  - In stock items only
  - User's preferred category
  - Within price range
Display: Top 5 matches
Fallback: Show cached data if API fails
```

## Dynamic List Node

### Purpose
Generate dynamic lists of options based on data queries and user context.

### Features
- **Query-based Generation**: Create lists from database queries
- **Contextual Filtering**: Filter based on user context and preferences
- **Sorting Options**: Multiple sorting criteria for list organization
- **Pagination Support**: Handle large datasets efficiently

### Configuration
- **Data Query**: SQL query or API call to generate list
- **Sorting Criteria**: How to order list items
- **Filter Parameters**: User-specific filtering options
- **Display Limits**: Maximum items to show per page

### List Features
- **Smart Sorting**: Intelligent ordering based on relevance
- **Category Grouping**: Organize items by categories
- **Search Integration**: Allow users to search within lists
- **Infinite Scroll**: Load more items as user scrolls
- **Quick Filters**: Rapid filtering options for users

### Use Cases
- Product catalog browsing
- Service provider listings
- Event schedules
- Contact directories
- Content libraries

### Example Configuration
```
Query: SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = {user_category}
Sort By: popularity DESC, price ASC
Filters:
  - Price range: {user_budget}
  - Brand: {user_preferences}
  - Rating: >= 4 stars
Items per page: 10
Search: Enabled
```

### Advanced Features
- **Machine Learning**: Learn from user interactions to improve recommendations
- **A/B Testing**: Test different list configurations
- **Performance Analytics**: Track list engagement and conversion
- **Personalization**: Adapt lists to individual user preferences
- **Real-time Updates**: Keep lists current with live data

### Integration Capabilities
- **CRM Systems**: Pull customer data for personalization
- **Inventory Management**: Show real-time stock levels
- **Analytics Platforms**: Track user interactions with lists
- **Payment Systems**: Enable direct purchasing from lists
- **External APIs**: Integrate with third-party data sources

### Best Practices
- **Performance**: Optimize queries for fast loading
- **User Experience**: Design intuitive list interfaces
- **Data Quality**: Ensure accurate and up-to-date information
- **Mobile Optimization**: Ensure lists work well on mobile devices
- **Error Handling**: Gracefully handle data loading failures

## Advanced Dynamic Features

### Machine Learning Integration
- **Predictive Models**: Predict user choice preferences
- **Clustering Algorithms**: Group similar users and choices
- **Neural Networks**: Deep learning for choice optimization
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Learn from user feedback

### Real-time Optimization
- **Live Performance Monitoring**: Track choice effectiveness
- **Automatic Adjustments**: Modify choices based on performance
- **Feedback Loops**: Incorporate user feedback immediately
- **Continuous Improvement**: Constantly optimize choice systems

### Cross-platform Synchronization
- **Multi-device Consistency**: Sync choices across devices
- **Platform Adaptation**: Adapt choices to different platforms
- **Unified Profiles**: Maintain consistent user profiles
- **Cross-channel Learning**: Learn from all user interactions

## Best Practices

### User Experience
- **Choice Overload**: Avoid overwhelming users with too many options
- **Clear Labeling**: Make choice options clear and understandable
- **Consistent Behavior**: Maintain predictable choice behavior
- **Feedback Provision**: Show users why certain choices are suggested

### Performance
- **Efficient Algorithms**: Use optimized algorithms for real-time processing
- **Caching Strategies**: Cache frequently accessed choice data
- **Load Balancing**: Distribute processing across systems
- **Graceful Degradation**: Provide fallbacks when systems fail

### Privacy and Ethics
- **Data Privacy**: Protect user data used for personalization
- **Transparency**: Be clear about how choices are determined
- **User Control**: Allow users to control personalization
- **Bias Prevention**: Avoid discriminatory choice algorithms

### Testing and Optimization
- **Continuous Testing**: Regularly test choice effectiveness
- **User Feedback**: Collect and act on user feedback
- **Performance Monitoring**: Track choice system performance
- **Iterative Improvement**: Continuously refine choice algorithms

:::tip
Start with simple dynamic choice implementations and gradually add complexity. Monitor user behavior and feedback to understand what types of dynamic choices work best for your audience.

:::warning
Dynamic choice systems can become complex quickly. Ensure you have proper monitoring, testing, and fallback mechanisms to maintain a good user experience even when dynamic systems fail.

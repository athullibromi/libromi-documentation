This guide will walk you through the process of importing multiple contacts at once into your Libromi Connect account using a CSV or Excel file. This is an efficient way to add your existing contact lists without manual entry.

## Step 1: Prepare Your Contact File

Before you can import your contacts, you need to format your contact list correctly in a spreadsheet.

### Create a Spreadsheet
Open a new sheet in Google Sheets, Microsoft Excel, or any other spreadsheet software.

### Set Up Columns
Create the following columns in your spreadsheet. The column headers must be exactly as written below:

- **name**: The full name of the contact.
- **phone_number**: The contact's WhatsApp number. **Important**: Include the country code for each number (e.g., 91 for India, 1 for the USA).
- **group**: The name of a specific group you wish to add the contact to. You can create new groups through this import.

### Add Your Contacts
Fill in the rows with your contact information.

### Download the File
Save or export your spreadsheet. Libromi Connect supports CSV, XLS, and XLSX file formats up to 10MB.

:::tip Pro Tip

## Step 2: Navigate to the Import Section

1. From your Libromi Connect dashboard, locate the main navigation menu on the left side of the screen.
2. Click on the **Contacts** icon.
3. From the expanded contact menu, select **Import & Export**.

## Step 3: Upload Your Contact File

1. You are now on the "Import & Export" page.
2. You can either **drag and drop** your prepared contact file directly into the "Upload your File" area.
3. Alternatively, click the **Select File** button. This will open your computer's file explorer.
4. Locate the contact file you prepared in Step 1 and select it to begin the upload.

## Step 4: Check the Import Status

- After uploading the file, the system will begin processing the import.
- You can monitor the status of your import session in the **Import History** section on the same page.
- If the import is successful, your new contacts will appear in the **All Contacts** section.

## Troubleshooting

If you receive an "Import Failed" error, please check the following:

### File Format
Ensure your file is saved as a `.csv`, `.xls`, or `.xlsx`.

### Column Headers
Double-check that your column headers are exactly `name`, `phone_number`, and `group`.

### Phone Number Format
Verify that all phone numbers include their respective country codes and do not contain any special characters or spaces.

### File Size
Make sure your file is not larger than 10MB.

:::warning Important
Always include country codes in phone numbers and ensure your column headers match exactly: `name`, `phone_number`, and `group`.

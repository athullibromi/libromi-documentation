# Contact Management Overview

The Contacts section is the central hub for managing your entire audience within Libromi Connect. Here, you can store, organize, filter, and communicate with all the users who have interacted with your WhatsApp number. Effective contact management is key to running targeted campaigns and providing personalized customer support.

This guide covers all the core functionalities available in the Contacts module.

## Key Features

- **Centralized Contact Dashboard**: View and search your entire contact list in one place
- **Manual and Bulk Importing**: Add contacts one-by-one or import thousands at once from a file
- **Contact Groups**: Segment your audience into groups for targeted messaging and better organization
- **Direct Conversation Initiation**: Start conversations with users directly from the contact list using pre-approved templates
- **Flexible Exporting**: Download your contact lists with powerful filters in CSV or Excel formats

## 1. The Contacts Dashboard

When you navigate to **Contacts > All Contacts**, you are presented with a master list of everyone who has been added to your system.

- **Viewing Contacts**: The list is paginated for easy browsing and displays the contact's Name, Phone number, and the Created date
- **Searching and Filtering**: Use the search bar at the top to quickly find a specific contact by their name or phone number
- **Actions Menu**: Each contact has a three-dot menu (⋮) on the right side with options to Initiate Conversation, Edit, or Delete

## 2. Adding and Managing Individual Contacts

### Adding a New Contact

1. Navigate to the **All Contacts** page
2. Click the **+ Add Contact** button in the top-right corner
3. In the "Add New Contact" window, fill in the following details:
   - **Name**: The full name of the contact
   - **Country & Phone Number**: Select the contact's country from the dropdown menu (this will pre-fill the country code) and enter their phone number. A valid phone number is required
   - **Groups (Optional)**: Click the dropdown to assign the contact to one or more existing groups. This helps with segmentation
4. Click **Create Contact** to save

### Editing a Contact

1. Find the contact you wish to update in the **All Contacts** list
2. Click the **Actions menu (⋮)** on the right and select **Edit**
3. In the "Update Contact" window, you can modify the contact's name, phone number, and group assignments
4. Click **Update Contact** to save the changes

### Deleting a Contact

To permanently remove a contact, click the **Actions menu (⋮)** and select **Delete**.

**Important Note**: Contacts can only be deleted if there is no chat history associated with them. If a contact has any conversation history, the delete option will not be available to preserve data integrity and compliance requirements.

## 3. Organizing Contacts with Groups

Groups are the best way to segment your audience for targeted broadcast campaigns or to simply keep your contacts organized (e.g., "New Leads," "VIP Customers," "Support Inquiries").

### Creating a New Group

1. Navigate to **Contacts > Groups**
2. Click the **Create Group** button
3. Enter a descriptive name for your group in the "Group Name" field
4. Click **Create Group** to finish

### Viewing Group Members

From the **Groups** page, simply click on any group card to view a filtered list of all the contacts assigned to that specific group.

## 4. Communicating with Your Contacts

You can start conversations directly from the Contacts dashboard.

### View Full Conversation

Clicking anywhere on a contact's row (other than the Actions menu) will take you to the **Team Inbox** view for that specific user, where you can see their full chat history.

### Initiate a Conversation (Template Message)

1. Find the desired contact and click their **Actions menu (⋮)**
2. Select **Initiate Conversation**
3. Choose a pre-approved message template from the dropdown list
4. If the template contains dynamic variables (e.g., for an order number or name), fill in the required parameter fields
5. Click **Send** to start the conversation

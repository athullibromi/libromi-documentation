# How to Export Your Contacts

Exporting contacts from Libromi Connect allows you to create backups, perform external data analysis, or import your audience into other marketing platforms. The powerful filtering options enable you to download precisely the segments you need.

This guide will walk you through the process of exporting your contacts into a CSV or Excel file.

## Step 1: Navigate to the Export Section

1. From the main dashboard, click on the **Contacts** icon in the left-side navigation menu
2. Select **Import & Export** from the submenu
3. On the "Import & Export" page, click the **Export** tab at the top

## Step 2: Configure Your Export Options

1. Click the purple **Export Contacts** button. This will open the "Export Options" pop-up window where you can customize your file

### Choose Export Format

- **CSV File**: A plain text format that is universally compatible with most spreadsheet and database applications
- **Excel File**: A native Microsoft Excel format (.xlsx), which is best if you plan to work with the data directly in Excel

### Apply Filters (Optional)

Use the filters to create a targeted list of contacts for your export. You can use any combination of the following:

#### Created After

Click the "Select date" field to open a calendar. Choose a date to export only the contacts that were added to your system after this specific date.

#### Do Not Disturb (DND) Status

This filter allows you to segment contacts based on whether they have opted out of receiving messages:

- **All**: Exports all contacts, regardless of their DND status
- **DND Only**: Exports only the contacts who have an active DND status

#### Contact Groups

Click the dropdown menu to select specific groups. Check the box next to each group you wish to include in the export. This is perfect for downloading specific audience segments.

2. After setting your desired format and filters, click the **Export Contacts** button at the bottom of the window to begin the process

## Step 3: Download Your Exported File

1. The export process runs in the background and does not provide an immediate download
2. Your new export job will appear at the top of the **Export History** list on the "Import & Export" page. Its initial status will be "Processing"
3. Once the file is ready, the status will change to **COMPLETED**
4. You can click **Details** to expand the entry and review the exact filters that were applied to that specific export, ensuring it's the correct file
5. Click the green **Download** button to save the contact file to your computer

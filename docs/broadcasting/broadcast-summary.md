# How to Send a Broadcast Message

This guide will walk you through the entire process of creating a campaign, composing a broadcast message, selecting your audience, and launching it.

2. **Click the purple "Create Campaign" button** located in the top-right corner.  
3. A **"Create Campaign" window** will appear.  
4. In the **Name** field, enter a clear and descriptive name for your campaign (e.g., *Christmas Sale* or *Q2 Customer Survey*).  
5. In the **Description** field, provide a brief summary of the campaign's purpose.  
6. **Click "Create Campaign"** to save. Your new campaign will now appear as a card on the dashboard.

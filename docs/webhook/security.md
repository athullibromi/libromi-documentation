# Security Best Practices

While Libromi Connect webhooks are designed to be simple and secure, it's important to follow best practices when integrating external systems with your webhook scenarios.

## Webhook URL Security

### Keep URLs Private
- Your webhook URL is unique and should be treated as sensitive information
- Don't share webhook URLs in public repositories or documentation
- Limit access to webhook URLs to authorized team members only

### URL Management
- Use different webhook URLs for different environments (development, staging, production)
- Regenerate webhook URLs if they become compromised
- Monitor webhook usage through the dashboard

## External System Security

### HTTPS Requirements
When sending data to your Libromi Connect webhook:
- Always use HTTPS for secure data transmission
- Ensure your external system validates SSL certificates
- Never send sensitive data over unencrypted connections

### Data Validation
Implement validation in your external systems before sending data:

```javascript
// Example: Validate data before sending to webhook
function validateWebhookData(data) {
  if (!data.phone_number || !data.name) {
    throw new Error('Required fields missing');
  }
  
  // Validate phone number format
  if (!/^\d{10,15}$/.test(data.phone_number)) {
    throw new Error('Invalid phone number format');
  }
  
  return true;
}

// Send data only after validation
if (validateWebhookData(customerData)) {
  sendToWebhook(customerData);
}
```

## Data Protection

### Sensitive Information
- Avoid sending sensitive data like passwords, credit card numbers, or personal identification numbers
- Use customer IDs or reference numbers instead of full personal details when possible
- Implement data minimization - only send data that's necessary for the automation

### Phone Number Security
- Ensure phone numbers are properly formatted and validated
- Store phone numbers securely in your systems
- Consider using hashed or encrypted identifiers for additional security

## Access Control

### Team Access
- Limit webhook creation and modification to authorized team members
- Use role-based access control in your Libromi Connect account
- Regularly review who has access to webhook configurations

### System Integration
- Use service accounts or API keys for system-to-system integrations
- Implement proper authentication in your external systems
- Log webhook activities for audit purposes

## Monitoring and Logging

### Webhook Activity
Monitor your webhook scenarios through the Libromi Connect dashboard:
- Check execution logs for successful and failed triggers
- Monitor message delivery status
- Review error messages and troubleshoot issues

### External System Logging
Implement logging in your external systems:

```javascript
// Example: Log webhook requests
function sendToWebhook(data) {
  console.log(`Sending webhook data for customer: ${data.name}`);
  
  fetch(webhookUrl, {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify(data)
  })
  .then(response => {
    if (response.ok) {
      console.log('Webhook sent successfully');
    } else {
      console.error('Webhook failed:', response.status);
    }
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.error('Webhook error:', error);
  });
}
```

## Error Handling

### Graceful Failures
Implement proper error handling in your external systems:

```javascript
async function sendWebhookWithRetry(data, maxRetries = 3) {
  for (let attempt = 1; attempt <= maxRetries; attempt++) {
    try {
      const response = await fetch(webhookUrl, {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
        body: JSON.stringify(data)
      });
      
      if (response.ok) {
        console.log('Webhook sent successfully');
        return;
      }
      
      throw new Error(`HTTP ${response.status}`);
    } catch (error) {
      console.log(`Webhook attempt ${attempt} failed:`, error.message);
      
      if (attempt === maxRetries) {
        console.error('All webhook attempts failed');
        // Handle final failure (log, alert, etc.)
      } else {
        // Wait before retry
        await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 1000 * attempt));
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Testing Security

### Development Environment
- Use separate webhook URLs for testing
- Test with sample data that doesn't contain real customer information
- Validate that your scenarios work correctly before going live

### Production Deployment
- Test webhook integrations thoroughly before production deployment
- Monitor initial production usage closely
- Have rollback procedures ready in case of issues

## Compliance Considerations

### Data Privacy
- Ensure compliance with data protection regulations (GDPR, CCPA, etc.)
- Implement proper consent mechanisms for customer communications
- Provide opt-out mechanisms for automated messages

### Message Content
- Use approved WhatsApp Business templates only
- Ensure message content complies with WhatsApp Business policies
- Avoid sending promotional content without proper consent

## Best Practices Summary

1. **Keep webhook URLs secure and private**
2. **Use HTTPS for all external system communications**
3. **Validate data before sending to webhooks**
4. **Implement proper error handling and retry logic**
5. **Monitor webhook activity and system logs**
6. **Follow data protection and privacy regulations**
7. **Test thoroughly in development before production deployment**
8. **Use role-based access control for team members**
9. **Regularly review and audit webhook configurations**
10. **Keep external systems and integrations up to date**

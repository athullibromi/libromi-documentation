# How to Block & Unblock Customers

Learn how to manage customer access by blocking and unblocking users when necessary for maintaining a safe and productive communication environment.

## Overview

Blocking customers is a moderation tool that prevents specific users from sending messages to your team. This feature should be used judiciously and typically reserved for cases involving abuse, spam, or inappropriate behavior.

## When to Block Customers

### Appropriate Reasons
- **Abusive language**: Customers using offensive or threatening language
- **Spam messages**: Repeated irrelevant or promotional messages
- **Harassment**: Persistent unwanted contact after being asked to stop
- **Fraudulent activity**: Suspected scam or fraudulent behavior
- **Terms violation**: Customers violating your terms of service

### Consider Alternatives First
- Warning the customer about inappropriate behavior
- Setting conversation limits or restrictions
- Escalating to a supervisor for resolution
- Offering alternative communication channels

## Blocking a Customer

### Step-by-Step Process
1. Open the customer's conversation or profile
2. Click on the customer options menu (usually three dots)
3. Select "Block Customer" or "Block User"
4. Choose the reason for blocking from the dropdown
5. Add optional notes explaining the decision
6. Confirm the blocking action

### Block Options
- **Temporary block**: Set a specific duration (hours, days, weeks)
- **Permanent block**: Block indefinitely until manually unblocked
- **Partial block**: Block from specific channels while allowing others

## Effects of Blocking

### What Happens When Blocked
- Customer cannot send new messages
- Existing conversations are archived or marked as blocked
- Customer may receive an automated message (if configured)
- Block status is logged in customer history

### Team Notifications
- Team members are notified of the block
- Block reason and duration are recorded
- Blocked customer list is updated
- Relevant managers may receive alerts

## Unblocking Customers

### When to Unblock
- Customer has apologized and committed to appropriate behavior
- Temporary block period has expired
- Misunderstanding has been resolved
- Customer has demonstrated changed behavior through other channels

### Unblocking Process
1. Navigate to the blocked customers list
2. Find the customer you want to unblock
3. Click "Unblock" or "Remove Block"
4. Review the original block reason
5. Add notes about why you're unblocking
6. Confirm the unblock action

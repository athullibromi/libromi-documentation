## Document Requirements

**Required Documents for Business Verification:**

Only **two** documents are required for business verification. The primary document types that are acceptable for business verification are as follows. Make sure that these documents are not expired and are issued by the relevant authorities:

- **Certificate/Articles of Incorporation**
- **Business Registration or Licence Document**
- **Government-Issued Business Tax Document:** This could include a tax certificate. _Self-filed tax documents are not accepted._
- **Business Bank Statement**
- **Utility Bill:** A utility bill is only accepted for verifying the business address and phone number. The legal business name must be on the utility bill. _A utility bill is not an acceptable document for legal business name verification._

## **Document Requirements by Country**

| **Country** | **Required Documents**                          |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| India       | MSME Certificate, Utility Bill, GST Certificate |
| UAE         | Trade License & VAT Certificate                 |
| US          | Trade License & VAT Certificate                 |

## Phone Number

The number you wish to set up as your WhatsApp API number must not be registered on WhatsApp. To avoid any complications, it’s recommended to use a fresh number.&#x20;

If you want to convert a number from the WhatsApp Business App to an API number connected to DoubleTick, you must either delete the number from WhatsApp or follow the Change Number procedure.

By ensuring that all the above requirements are met, your onboarding process with the WhatsApp API will be streamlined and compliant with Meta's policies.
